# Within this branch, one can find the workflow below
### Data preprocessing, load dataset, libraries, merge data in data_prep <br>
### Data Exploration in data_exploration <br>
### The model testing folder that tests our model on a slightly different dataset <br>
Trial3 dataset has included all the features from Austin Housing data, including income, population, and density by zip code <br>
The single-family dataset has the same variables as Trial3 but reduces to only single-family home type due to class imbalance.
